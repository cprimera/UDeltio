I'm a fourth year at the University of Toronto working towards an HBSc Computer Science Specialist degree with an interest in security, mobile development and low-level programming/embedded systems. I also have a Computer Systems Technician - Software Engineering diploma from Sheridan College. I have experience in many programming language including C, Objective-C, Swift, Java, Python and assembly as well as HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP for web development. I have worked on many projects both for hackathons and for school, such as [Skvallra](http://www.github.com/cprimera/skvallra), and [Toronto Bixi Finder](https://github.com/cprimera/BixiBike) which was a finalist in the Toronto LinkedIn Hackday.

## The Project

###Messaging Application for Universities

After carefully considering the suggested project options our group chose to build a messaging application as our product. The decision was unanimous and was reached quickly, as all team members share the same motivation and consider this option as the most interesting and necessary.

The motivation for us to choose this option is that we would like to provide convenient ways for our users to receive news from the topics that interest them. Another, equivalently important reason, is that we would like to improve communication between students and instructors.

Today there exist many applications that provide similar functionality. However, while our university is using some external products to fill this niche, one point to note here is that some students are unhappy as they have to provide their personal information to a third party. We would like to create an application that would belong to our university and will be hosted on its servers to solve this problem.

## User Stories

## MVP

Our product UDeltio is a bulletin board for University communities. Deltio stands for Bulletin in Greek.

UDeltio allows members of the community to start and join bulletin boards. Allowing them to post notices and get notifications for bulletin boards they’re a member of.

For private sub-communities inside the University, you can have private boards. Where only the members can see the posted notices.

UDeltio will be a web application, allowing users to access the bulletin board from any where they want to. They will also receive notifications for boards they have subscribed to.


## Release & Iteration Planning

### User stories to be implemented in first release

| User Stories |Role|
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| I want to create a new board.| Instructor / Student|
| I want to be able to subscribe to the board.|Instructor / Student|
| I want to post texts and links in the board I am subscribed to.|Instructor / Student|
| I want to participate in the class discussion board without sharing my private information with a third-party so that i can participate in the class discussions without feeling like my privacy has been violated|Student|
| I want to be able to search for a specific board so that it’s easy to find the messages I want to view.|Instructor / Student|

The reason for us to select these user stories for our first release is because they cover the core functionality of the system. Consequentially, they have the highest priority in our journal containing user stories. 

### 3 user-stories excluded from first release:
* I want to be able to group my classes and my extra-curriculars into separate sections on the message board so that I can keep my school work and recreational activities separate
 * This is a nice feature, but it is not required for a core functionality.
* I want to mark some posts as important. For example, the post saying the exam room is changed should be marked as important.
 * This feature could be added later on. At the initial stages of the project, core functionality of the product will not be affected if all posts have equal priority.
* I want to be able to flag inappropriate posts so that I’m not subjected to offensive messages
 * This feature is not important for the core functionality of the application. 

### User stories to implement in the first iteration
The team is not planning to implement any user stories over the first iteration. Instead, the team will focus on setting up the back-end, creating API, thinking through UI, and getting familiarized with front-end components we plan on using.
