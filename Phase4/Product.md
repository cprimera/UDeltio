## Two Scenarios of how typical users would use UDeltio:

### Scenario 1 (Typical use case for a student using a class board):

Say you are a student in MAT2045 at a university which is using UDeltio for discussion boards. This is a difficult course and you are having a hard time with the course work. You are sent an email notification from your professor which says that they have added assignment aids to the course discussion board. Since you are enrolled in a university that is using UDeltio, it is not necessary to create a login and password for a third party. Instead, you simply login with your university credentials (ie your utorid and password). Once logged in you select ‘MAT2045 Discussion Board’ from the boards on your profile page This board is visible from your profile page since you have previously added it to your favourites. The professor has embedded a YouTube video and also posted some pictures intended to help students with the course work. After viewing this post you are very thankful and post a new message to the board that says ‘Thanks very much for the help!’.

(This is a real scenario, as two of team members were in the class in which a discussion board on a third-party resource was taken down due to a complaint that the students should not share their information with a third party. A substitute board was never set up and the students did not have a benefit of assignment discussion or notifications. We feel that having a messaging board application that is running on university servers would have solved this problem). 

### Scenario 2 (Use case for someone in the university community that is not a student):

Say you are Domingo Montoya and your friend invites you to join a fencing class at McMaster University over the Summer. You are not a student at McMaster, however, you would still benefit from being able to see information in regards to the fencing class you are signing up for This is an example of where you are a member of a university community but you are not a student at the school. Since you are not a student at the school but would still benefit from viewing the discussion board, you are given a generic username and password that allows you read access to the ‘PrincessBrideFencing’ board. Once logged into the sight you open the ‘PrincessBrideFencing’ board from your profile page.  You see that another user, ‘SixFingeredMan’, has posted on the board. As a response to this you post ‘‘I am Domingo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die/see you in class!!’.

(This is a funny version of a real scenario where one of team members took a fencing class at the university but was not a student there at the time. He feels he would have benefited from having access to a message board like UDeltio for that course).
